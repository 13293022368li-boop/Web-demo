        <p>Welcome to <strong>Harpe Gaming</strong>.We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points: </p> 
    <p></p>
        <li>Unplug</li>
        <li>Interact</li>
        <li>Reconnect</li>
    <p></p> 
        And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones that bring people together through shared experiences. With all due respect to our video<br>
        gamer friends, you can't always get that from a pcomputer screen. Sometimes you need the intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around a<br>
        common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.<br>
    <p></p> 
        We are a local board and card game store located in the heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry hundreds of games and puzzles, including<br> 
        educational games, family games, card games, historical simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. If you remember a great game from<br>
        your youth, we probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.<br>
    <p></p>
        We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate gaming and the company of good friends. Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down,<br>
        pick out a game from our demo library and start playing. We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special social events. You'll always find a game to play.<br>
    <p></p>
        We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out our reviews of <a href="hg_towers.html">Towers and Temples</a>  and<br>
       <a href="hg_alliance.html">Alliance</a>; both new this month at Harpe Gaming.<br>
